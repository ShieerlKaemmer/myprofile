								<p>My name is Shieerl Kaemmer. I was born in Indonesia. I can speak 3 languages which are Indonesian, English and Chinese.I used to live in China for almost 6 years and that is the reason why i can speak Chinese.</p>
								<p>I have an older sister who was also one of the student in RMIT. My hobby is listening to music as it always makes me feel calm whenever i listen to it. The other hobby would be travelling as it helps me to learn different cultures and languages everytime when i travel to different country outside Indonesia.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>When I was in grade 9, I had no idea about what major I will take in the future. At that time, I was thinking about taking management or international business since these 2 majors are the most common choice when you do not really know what major to take in the university. I would say my ICT teacher in grade 10 was the one who sparked my interest in IT, he always encourages me during ICT class and even gave me a scholarship for my IGCSE test. All the things he had done for me made me believe that I am actually capable for taking IT as my major in university..</p>
								<p>One of the reasons why I chose RMIT is because my sister was also one of the graduates from RMIT, so we know that RMIT offer an excellent education for their students. Another reason is because of the opportunities they offer would be really useful in the future, so I decided to go to RMIT when I was in my foundation year.</p>
								<p>I am actually expecting to learn how to make an application since it sounds really interesting. Gaming application sounds great as i love to play game when i have nothing to at home. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Mobile application developer would be a really good idea when it comes to my ideal job, it can be any applications such as gaming application, fitness application and etc. Why is this position appealing to me? It sounds really interesting as it involves designing and developing a mobile application for people who need them, and it is really comforting to hear if the user actually likes the application you developed for them.</p>
								<p>For this job, you will have to gain a degree that is relates with IT, understand how to use JavaScript or HTML, getting familiar with SQL, have a great communication skill, understand how business works and problem-solving skills.</p>
								<p>I just started to learn most of it by this year, which is my first year of university. For HTML and SQL, I have learnt the basic part in my high school, so I think it will not be a big deal when we get it into this lesson.</p>
								<p>My plan would be trying to understand all when I am still in my university year. As I have started to learn java this year, it is one of the most important lesson that helps me to get an ideal job that I want.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/16p.png" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/LST.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>These results 90% describes what kind of person I am. Learning style test result states that I am more to logical, social and solitary person. Meanwhile in 16 personalities test, it stated that I am an introvert and observant person which mean that I will not talk much and more to observing when it comes to forming a group or socialize with other people.</p>
								<p>It could affect my behavior in a team as I am a quiet person and will not to talk much when there is a group project especially with people that I just met. People might find it hard to talk to me as i reply as little as i can.</p>
								<p>When it comes to forming a team, I would say I prefer to find people that is actually extrovert as it will makes me to talk more as well. As long as I am getting know more about them then I do not think there could be a problem when forming a team.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Project Ideas</h2>
								<p>For this project, I would say develop an application, especially gaming application is the most interesting out of all when I first saw the project idea lists. It can be any game categories such as action, educational, simulation and etc. I would like to try how to make a game about escape room as I love to play escape room when I was in my hometown, but it is expensive for me to play. Therefore, I thought it would be a good idea to make an escape room simulation game.</p>
								<p>As I mention that mobile application developer is my ideal job, it would be really interesting for me to learn how to develop a gaming app using any programming languages or tools such as unity, Construct2 or Cocos2d as it will give me the experience I need when I have to develop a application, even though it is a game application but I thought it still might be a useful experience for me. According to an article in GeekWire, there are around 1.2 billion people play games in this world and the users are mostly teenager, so it is easier for us to target the user, which is teenager who loves playing escape room.</p>
								<p>As I mention before that I want to make an escape room game, it is a game specially design for people who likes to play escape room but does not want to pay too much for it. Even though it is just a simulation but since it is free, so I thought It would be a good idea to design it for them. The game will ask the user to find a way to escape the room by finding an object or hints inside the room that will lead the user to escape the room they are staying at the moment. The difficulties for the next level will increase as the user successfully escape from the previous room. When you can’t continue anymore as you have no idea what to do next, you are allowed to ask for help and we will give you a hint which might help you to find the key or objects you need, but of course the hint are limited as we still want user to figure out themselves, it is not fun when we spoil the answers at one time, so the user will have to wait 15 minutes to get the next hint and there is no hint available when you point is zero. How does user earn points? It is given every time when you finish one level, the less hint you ask, the more point will be given, but there is a minimum points given to the user every time they finish one level, so they do not have to worry about no hint given on the next level. As the difficulties increases, the points given will increases as well, since we do not want user to struggle to much when they are using our project, so they do not have to worry that only one or few hints will be given next level. The user will repeat the same way until they have reached the maximum level of our game.</p>
								<p>The tool needed would be either Unity, construct2 or Cocos2d, it’s a tool which you can use it for creating a gaming application. I would choose Unity as it is more famous compare to construct2 or cocos2d, and I saw their description saying that there are more than 50% of mobile games are made from Unity so I thought it would be a good idea to use unity for this project. Unity has a really good reputation among game developer as I scroll through the reviews and feedbacks every game developer company gave them on their website. Thus, I would say using Unity will be easier for us as there are so many companies using it, so when we have a problem that have to fix, it might be easier for us to find the solutions.</p>
								<p>Basically, there are 3 unity plans available on their website. There is a free version for beginner, 35$ per month for hobbyist and 125$ per months for team and freelancer. It depends for everyone needs, but I think the free version or the 35$ plan would be enough as we are using it for IT project, so I think 125$ in unnecessary for us since we are not a game developer company. We only have to download unity into our laptop so it will not take much time to get ready for the project.</p>
								<p>If the project is successful, an escape room game application would be the outcome. People who needs to entertain themselves during free time can play our gaming application whenever they want. I believe that people who likes escape room game will love our game as it is free, and they can play anytime they want without someone has to tell them that they reach the time limit. </p>
